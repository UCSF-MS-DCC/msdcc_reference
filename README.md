# MS DCC Reference

This is a simple CRUD app to serve as a specialized wiki for the MS DCC.

Once launched, the app will be able to be viewed by anyone, while creating and editing features will be more restricted.

Each entry in the Reference (term) will have a definition and perhaps links to outside references, content tags to call up related terms and images.

This is a part time project, with updates and commits coming whenever we can manage.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
